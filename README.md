### [Identity Atelier](https://id-atelier.com)
Personal style consulting that blends aesthetics and psychology. Founded by Ana Gayd, Identity Atelier goes beyond fashion trends and rules—helping clients discover the visual language of their identity through archetype-guided discovery, visual pattern recognition, and one-on-one insight sessions. This original approach draws from neuropsychology, architecture, design, and fashion to create a science-informed personal style journey.

> “Not fashion. Not trends. Not rules. Your essence. Styled your way.”
